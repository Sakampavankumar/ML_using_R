The program consists of data files (csv and txt) used for practice R programming and the introduction of Machine Learning as well as R code.  

The R code consists of 19 files: 1-4 are for learning R basic programming, 5-15 Supervised Machine Learning, 16-17 Data partitioning/cross validation, 18-19 Unsupervised Machine Learning. 

The data is simulated data meant to represent heart failure patient demographics and outcomes with possible outcomes related to treatment costs, mortality, and readmission.
